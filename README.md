## Features
- **Navigation**
    - At the top of the page is the navigation bar. The Mindful Peace is to the left and links to the start of the page. 
    - The other navigation links is About, Practice, Sign Up and Contact. It directs the users to the diffrent sections and sign up page.  
        
- **Main content**
    - The main content includes a _hero image_ that reminds the user to slown down.
    - It contains a short _About us_ section with a little information about the creator of the website and the function of the site. 
    - Under the About section is a link to a sign up form to the newsletter. The _Sign Up form_ is on a seperate page. If I would have more time, I would do a more detailed and attractive design to the Sign Up form. 
    - The sign up form follows by a section of a simple _Practice_ with a image and an ordered list. 
    - The _Footer_ is at the bottom, with links to different social media websites that opens in a new tab. 
## Testing
- I confirm that the links in the nav, newsletter sign up form and the footer is working correctly. 
- I confirm that the content on the site is readable and easy to understand.  

## Bugs
